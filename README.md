Here's a simple MIDI sketch you can run on Arduino. 

You'll need to have the following equipment:

* A [MIDI breakout](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9598) on your Arduino
* The [iPad camera connection kit](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A)
* A supported [USB MIDI device](http://iosmidi.com/devices/)
* An app like [Pianist Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pianist-pro/id358857758?mt=8)

You also will need some basic sensors attached:

* A photoresistor on analog pin 0 to vary the pitch
* A pushbutton on digital pin 2 to play notes
